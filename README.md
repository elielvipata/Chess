Swift Chess
------------

- Forked from 
Nick Lockwood @nicklockwood

This is a simple chess game for iPhone and iPad, designed for novice players. That I'll be using as an artificial intelligence project

Algorithms Implemented:
- [ ] Basic Reflex -  From original code with a few changes to accomadate newer algorithms
- [ ] Minimax - Analyzing player moves and comparing them based on a consistent heuristic
- [ ] Alpha Beta pruning -  Pruning unnecessary moves generated by minimax

Minimax and Alpa Beta pruning will be iterated to a max depth, of possible successor functions for each move.
